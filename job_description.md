At Google, a Product Manager (PM) is described as the "glue" that holds together cross-functional teams of engineers, designers, and marketers to bring new technologies to life. Google values PMs as generalists who can navigate the entire product lifecycle from inception to post-launch while being the "voice of the user". 
Core Responsibilities
Strategy & Vision: Define the product goal, long-term vision, and multi-year roadmaps that align with Google’s broader mission.
Execution & Launch: Guide products through the execution cycle, including writing Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), setting OKRs, and managing launches.
Market & User Research: Understand markets, competition, and user requirements in depth to ensure the product solves real customer pain points.
Cross-functional Collaboration: Act as the primary link between Engineering, UX/UI, Legal, Policy, Sales, and Marketing teams.
Data-Driven Iteration: Use data analysis and A/B testing to evaluate performance and iterate on products quickly. 
Standard Requirements
Education: A Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience is standard.
Experience:
Mid-Level: Typically requires 5+ years of product management experience and 2+ years of taking technical products from 0 to 1.
Senior-Level: Often requires 8+ years of experience in PM or as a co-founder.
Technical Chops: While not an engineering role, Google PMs are expected to have strong technical abilities to participate in system design and trade-off conversations.
Interpersonal Skills: Exceptional communication, organizational, and leadership skills are mandatory to influence teams without formal authority.
