**Key Changes and Why:**

1.  **Contact Information:** Added placeholders for LinkedIn and Portfolio, which are crucial for Google PM roles.
2.  **Objective to Professional Summary:**
    *   Replaced "Objective" with "Professional Summary" for a more experienced tone.
    *   Made it more impactful and tailored to Google's values ("solving complex user problems at scale," "world-changing products").
    *   Quantified experience (4.5 years total, 1.5 years PM).
    *   Highlighted key skills like data insights, user research, and cross-functional collaboration.
3.  **Functional Area Removed:** This section is redundant and often not parsed well by ATS. The keywords are integrated into the Summary and Skills.
4.  **Technical Skills:**
    *   **Consolidated and Organized:** Grouped similar skills for better readability and ATS parsing.
    *   **Added Keywords:** Ensured all relevant keywords from the JD are present and naturally integrated.
    *   **Removed Redundancy:** Removed the separate "Product Management" and "Product Research" lists as they were repetitive and could be better integrated.
    *   **Added Automation:** Explicitly listed UiPath and RPA.
5.  **Academics:** Simplified to just the B.Tech degree, as the intermediate/high school details are less relevant for a PM role at this stage.
6.  **Work Experience:**
    *   **Quantification is KEY:** This is the most significant change. I've added placeholders like `X%`, `Y%`, `Z%`, `A number`, `B%`, `C%`, `D%`, `10+ stakeholders`, `95% user acceptance`, `3 major product releases`, `5+ projects`, `25% reduction`, `10+ testing cycles`, `15 critical defects`, `20 hours per week`, `10% enhancement`, `4 critical applications`, `3 core business workflows`, `zero post-deployment critical issues`. **You MUST fill these in with your actual numbers.** This is non-negotiable for a Google PM application.
    *   **Action Verbs:** Started each bullet point with strong action verbs (Led, Managed, Contributed, Integrated, Analyzed, Conducted, Collaborated).
    *   **Impact-Oriented Language:** Focused on the *results* and *impact* of your actions, not just the tasks performed.
    *   **Reframed Earlier Roles:**
        *   **Analyst:** Highlighted the automation aspect (UiPath) and its direct business impact (efficiency, reduced manual effort).
        *   **Freelancing:** Positioned it as a Business Analyst/RPA Developer role, emphasizing user stories, client requirements, testing, and defect tracking – all relevant PM skills. Quantified project numbers and defect tracking.
    *   **Associate Product Manager:**
        *   Expanded on the existing points with more detail and impact.
        *   Explicitly mentioned "full product lifecycle," "requirement gathering from 10+ stakeholders," "user flows," "95% user acceptance," "OSS/BSS suites," "system security," "automating routine tasks," "system reliability," "strategic business objectives," "feature adoption," "client satisfaction," "3 major product releases," and "cross-functional teams (Engineering, QA, Sales)."
        *   Added a placeholder for the specific reduction in downtime and improvement in efficiency for the Network Orchestration tool.
7.  **Declaration Removed:** This is outdated and unnecessary.
8.  **Formatting:** Used bolding for emphasis on key achievements and technologies. Ensured consistent date formats.

**Next Steps for You:**

1.  **FILL IN THE NUMBERS:** Go back through your work experience and find concrete data to replace all the `X%`, `Y%`, `Z%`, `A number`, etc. This is the most critical step. Think about:
    *   Revenue generated or saved.
    *   User growth or engagement metrics.
    *   Efficiency gains (time saved, cost reduced).
    *   Adoption rates.
    *   Reduction in errors or downtime.
    *   Number of users, features, projects, stakeholders, releases, etc.
2.  **Tailor Further:** If you have specific Google products or areas you're passionate about, subtly weave that into your summary or cover letter.
3.  **LinkedIn Profile:** Ensure your LinkedIn profile is updated and mirrors this resume, with even more detail if possible.
4.  **Cover Letter:** Write a compelling cover letter that expands on your passion for product management at Google and highlights 1-2 key achievements from your resume.

This revised resume is significantly stronger and much more likely to pass ATS scans and impress a recruiter. Good luck!
