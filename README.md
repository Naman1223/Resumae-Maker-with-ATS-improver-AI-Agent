# Resume Maker with ATS Improver AI Agent 🚀

An intelligent agentic workflow that iteratively improves your resume to rank higher on Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Using Google's Gemini models, it analyzes your resume against a specific job description, provides feedback, and automatically rewrites the resume to maximize its score (aiming for >90).

## ✨ Features

- **Automated PDF to Markdown**: Extracts text from your resume PDF.
- **ATS Scoring**: Analyzes your resume against a provided Job Description (JD) and assigns a score (0-100).
- **Intelligent Feedback**: Generates detailed feedback on how to improve the resume.
- **Auto-Correction Loop**: Automatically rewrites the resume based on the feedback to improve the score.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Runs in a loop (up to 5 iterations) to continuously refine the resume.
- **Final Output Generation**: Converts the optimized markdown resume back into a PDF.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Resume-Maker-with-ATS-improver-AI-Agent
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # Mac/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Prepare your Resume:**
    *   Rename your resume PDF to `Resume-Nitin.pdf` (or update the path in `ATS_looper.py` line 18) and place it in the project root.

2.  **Run the Agent:**
    ```bash
    python ATS_looper.py
    ```

3.  **Input Job Description:**
    *   The script will prompt you to enter the Job Description.
    *   Paste the JD text into the terminal.
    *   Press `Ctrl+Z` (Windows) or `Ctrl+D` (Mac/Linux) and then `Enter` to save and proceed.

4.  **Wait for the Process:**
    *   The agent will enter a loop:
        *   **Score**: Scores the current version of the resume.
        *   **Correct**: Rewrites the resume based on feedback.
    *   It will iterate up to 5 times or until the score is satisfactory (logic implies improvement loop).

5.  **View Results:**
    *   `ats_corrected.md`: The final optimized resume content in Markdown.
    *   `ats_corrected_resume.pdf` (generated by `md_to_pdf.py`): The final PDF version of your resume.
    *   `ats_score.txt`: The latest ATS score.
    *   `ats_feedback.md`: Detailed feedback from the latest iteration.

## 📂 File Structure

- `ATS_looper.py`: Main orchestrator script that manages the input, input loop, and calls other scripts.
- `Score.py`: logic for scoring the resume against the JD using Gemini.
- `Correction.py`: Logic for rewriting the resume based on the scoring feedback.
- `md_to_pdf.py`: Utility to convert the final markdown file to a PDF.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `prompt_sys.md`: System prompt used for the scoring mechanism.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Ensure `Resume-Nitin.pdf` exists in the directory before running, or modify the source code to point to your specific filename.
- The loop is currently set to run 5 times (`counter < 5`). You can adjust this in `ATS_looper.py`.
