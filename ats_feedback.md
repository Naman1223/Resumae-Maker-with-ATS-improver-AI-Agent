**Impact & Quantification Evaluation:**

*   **Associate Product Manager:** Excellent use of quantification (e.g., "reducing network downtime by 15%", "improving operational efficiency by 20%", "boosting system security by 25%", "automating 30+ critical security tasks, saving 100+ hours monthly", "10% increase in feature adoption", "5% revenue growth", "95% on-time feature delivery", "3 major product iterations that improved user engagement by 18%").
*   **Freelancing / RPA Developer / Business Analyst:** Lacks specific numbers or metrics.
*   **Analyst:** Lacks specific numbers or metrics.

**Final ATS Score: 82%**

**Gap Analysis (Why the score isn't 100%):**

The primary reason for not achieving a 100% score is the **Role Relevancy** pillar, specifically the duration of direct Product Management experience. The job description explicitly requires "5+ years of product management experience" for Mid-Level and "8+ years" for Senior-Level. Your resume currently shows "1 year 5 months of direct product management experience." While your older roles demonstrate valuable transferable skills, they are not titled Product Manager roles, which ATS systems often heavily weigh.

Minor gaps include the explicit mention of "OKRs" and directly showcasing participation in "system design and trade-off conversations" as a PM, rather than just demonstrating technical implementation.

**Suggestions for Improvement (for AI to implement):**

1.  **Address Experience Duration & Relevancy:**
    *   **Reframe Older Roles:** For the "Freelancing / RPA Developer / Business Analyst" and "Analyst" roles, rephrase bullet points to explicitly highlight transferable Product Management skills. Focus on aspects like identifying user/client needs, defining requirements, contributing to solution strategy, managing stakeholders, and driving product/solution outcomes, even if the title wasn't "Product Manager."
    *   **Quantify Older Roles:** Review the "Freelancing / RPA Developer / Business Analyst" and "Analyst" sections to identify opportunities to add metrics, percentages, or numbers to demonstrate impact (e.g., "improved process efficiency by X%", "reduced manual effort by Y hours", "managed X projects"). This will boost the "Impact & Quantification" score for the entire resume.

2.  **Incorporate Missing Keywords:**
    *   **OKRs:** If you have experience with Objectives and Key Results, explicitly add "setting OKRs" or "contributing to OKR definition and tracking" to your "Core Competencies" or "Experience" section. If not, frame your KPI tracking and goal-setting experience in a way that aligns with the spirit of OKRs.
    *   **System Design Conversations:** In your "Associate Product Manager" experience, add a bullet point that explicitly states your involvement in "system design discussions," "technical architecture reviews," or "trade-off conversations" with engineering teams, demonstrating your "technical chops" beyond just implementation. For example: "Collaborated with engineering leadership on system architecture decisions and technical trade-offs for [product X] to ensure scalability and performance."

3.  **Strengthen "Strategy & Vision" Alignment:**
    *   In your "Associate Product Manager" section, add a bullet point that explicitly showcases your contribution to defining a "long-term vision" or "multi-year roadmaps" for a product, aligning with Google's emphasis on strategic thinking.

4.  **Tailor Professional Summary:**
    *   Refine the summary to more directly address Google's specific PM values, such as being a "generalist who can navigate the entire product lifecycle" and having "strong technical abilities to participate in system design and trade-off conversations." Explicitly state how your 0-1 experience and technical background make you a strong fit for Google's PM culture.

5.  **Enhance "Voice of the User" Narrative:**
    *   While "user needs" and "pain points" are mentioned, consider adding a bullet point that highlights your role as the "voice of the user" in product decisions, advocating for user-centric solutions throughout the development process.
