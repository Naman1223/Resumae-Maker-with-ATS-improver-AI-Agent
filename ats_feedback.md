Here's an ATS score for your resume against the Google Product Manager job description, along with detailed suggestions for improvement:

---

### ATS Score: 68/100

**Reasoning for Score:**

Your resume demonstrates a strong understanding of product management principles, excellent technical acumen, and a good grasp of Google's PM philosophy (e.g., using "glue" and "voice of the user"). You have many relevant keywords and quantifiable achievements.

However, the primary reason for this score, particularly for a "Mid-Level" Google PM role (which typically requires 5+ years of dedicated PM experience), is the **duration of your direct Product Manager experience**. The job description explicitly states "5+ years of product management experience" and "2+ years of taking technical products from 0 to 1." Your resume clearly states "1 year 5 months as a dedicated Product Manager," which is a significant gap. While your earlier roles involve product-adjacent responsibilities, an ATS primarily looks for direct title matches and explicit duration.

Your strong technical background and experience with "0 to 1" development are significant assets, but the ATS might filter you out based on the experience duration before a human reviewer sees these strengths.

### How to Fix Your ATS Score for a Google PM Role:

The goal is to bridge the experience gap and highlight your PM-relevant skills and impact more effectively across all your roles.

1.  **Address the Experience Duration Gap (Most Critical):**
    *   **Reframe Earlier Roles:** Your "Freelancer / RPA Developer / Business Analyst" and "Airodigital Labs Pvt. Ltd. / Analyst" roles contain significant product-centric responsibilities. You need to explicitly reframe these to highlight the "product management experience" within them.
        *   **Example for Freelancer:** Change title to "Freelancer / **Product Analyst & RPA Developer**" or "Freelancer / **Product Development Lead**". Then, ensure bullet points clearly articulate PM responsibilities like "product feature definition," "roadmap contribution," "user story management for product backlog," and "stakeholder alignment on product scope."
        *   **Example for Airodigital:** Change title to "Airodigital Labs Pvt. Ltd. / **Product Analyst & Automation Engineer**" or "Airodigital Labs Pvt. Ltd. / **Product Quality Analyst**". Emphasize "contributed to product quality and iteration by identifying software bugs and proposing data-driven improvements" more prominently and add more PM-centric language.
    *   **Calculate Total PM-Relevant Experience:** In your summary, instead of "including 1 year 5 months as a dedicated Product Manager," consider stating something like: "4+ years of product-centric experience, including 1 year 5 months as a dedicated Product Manager, with a strong foundation in product strategy, technical solution delivery, and user advocacy." This acknowledges the dedicated PM time while leveraging your broader experience.
    *   **Consider Target Role:** If the 5+ years is a hard requirement, you might be better suited for an Associate Product Manager (APM) or PM I role at Google, where the experience requirements are typically lower. Tailor your application accordingly.

2.  **Strengthen "0 to 1" Experience (Duration & Impact):**
    *   You have an excellent "0 to 1" example. Ensure you emphasize the *duration* of this project if it spanned a significant portion of your 1 year 5 months.
    *   If you contributed to other "0 to 1" initiatives in earlier roles (even if not leading), highlight them.
    *   Quantify the *impact* of your "0 to 1" product more. What market gap did it fill? What was its adoption rate? How did it contribute to revenue or user growth?

3.  **Integrate Missing Keywords & Quantifiable Impact into Experience:**
    *   **PRDs & OKRs:** While in skills, explicitly mention *writing* PRDs and *setting/tracking* OKRs in your work experience.
        *   *Example:* "Authored comprehensive **Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)**, detailing features, user stories, and technical specifications for [product], ensuring alignment across engineering and design."
        *   *Example:* "Defined and monitored **OKRs** to measure product success and team performance, leading to [quantifiable outcome]."
    *   **A/B Testing:** If you performed A/B testing, add it to your experience.
        *   *Example:* "Implemented **A/B testing** frameworks to validate feature hypotheses and optimize user engagement, resulting in a X% improvement in [metric]."
    *   **Cross-functional Collaboration:** Expand on the teams you collaborated with. The JD mentions Legal, Policy, Sales, and Marketing. If you interacted with these, include them.
        *   *Example:* "Acted as the primary liaison between Engineering, UX, QA, **Sales, and Marketing** teams to ensure seamless product development and go-to-market strategies."
    *   **Leadership & Influence:** Google values PMs who can influence without formal authority. Add bullet points that demonstrate this.
        *   *Example:* "Championed product vision and roadmap initiatives across engineering and design teams, securing buy-in and aligning priorities without direct authority."
        *   *Example:* "Mentored junior team members on product best practices and agile methodologies, fostering a culture of continuous improvement."
    *   **Data-Driven Iteration:** Provide more examples of using data to *iterate* and *improve* products, not just measure success.
        *   *Example:* "Leveraged **Mixpanel** and **Google Analytics** to analyze user behavior, identifying key friction points and iterating on [feature] to improve conversion by X%."

4.  **Refine Summary:**
    *   Make it more impactful and directly address the Google PM role.
    *   *Current:* "Results-oriented Product Leader with 4+ years of progressive experience in product development, strategy, and technical solution delivery, including 1 year 5 months as a dedicated Product Manager."
    *   *Suggestion:* "Highly technical and results-driven Product Manager with **4+ years of product-centric experience, including 1 year 5 months leading 0-to-1 technical product development.** Adept at acting as the 'glue' between cross-functional teams (Engineering, UX, Sales, Support) and serving as the 'voice of the user' to define multi-year product visions, roadmaps, and successful launches. Proven ability to leverage data analytics, user research, and deep technical acumen in SDN/SD-WAN to translate complex business needs into impactful, user-centric products. Seeking to apply a robust foundation in technical product development to a challenging Product Manager role at Google."

5.  **Tailor for Specific Google Roles:**
    *   Google has many PM roles. If you're applying for a specific role (e.g., Cloud Networking PM, AI/ML PM), heavily tailor your resume to that specific job description. Emphasize the technical skills and experiences most relevant to that team. Your current resume is very strong for a technical PM role, especially in networking/orchestration.

By implementing these changes, you can significantly improve your ATS score and better position yourself for a Google Product Manager role.
